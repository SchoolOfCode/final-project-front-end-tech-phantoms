1) Write a GHA workflow.yml for Continuous Testing
When a Pull Request is opened to merge into main or dev branches
We want to run tests that we have written

name: practice-continuous-test
on: pull request
for specific branches: main, dev
Steps
    Checkout repository
    Install node v16.13.1
    npm install
    npm run test

2) Write a GHA workflow.yml for Continuous Delivery/Deployment
After practice-continuous-test passes
We want to build and deploy to Netlify

Figure out:
- how to make job dependent on previous job completion (deploy after tests success) https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds
    - build two jobs in one .yml file, first job tests, second job will build and deploy
- how to build and deploy to Netlify using a workflow.yml 
    - research how to deploy your Next.js app on Netlify using Github Actions (https://thedaviddias.dev/blog/how-to-deploy-your-nextjs-app-on-netlify-using-github-actions/)
    - we don't use any Actions but GHA marketplace link for a Netlify Actions plugin (https://github.com/marketplace/actions/netlify-actions)

We need separate into two workflow files
