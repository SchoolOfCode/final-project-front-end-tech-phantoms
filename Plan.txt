1) Write a GHA workflow.yml for Continuous Testing
When a Pull Request is opened to merge into main or dev branches
We want to run tests that we have written

name: practice-continuous-test
on: pull request
for specific branches: main, dev
Steps
    Checkout repository
    Install node v16.13.1
    npm install
    npm run test

2) Write a GHA workflow.yml for Continuous Delivery/Deployment
After practice-continuous-test passes
We want to build and deploy to Netlify

Figure out:
- how to make job dependent on previous job completion (deploy after tests success) 
- how to build and deploy to Netlify using a workflow.yml
    - research how to deploy your Next.js app on Netlify using Github Actions
    - GHA marketplace for a Actions plugin
