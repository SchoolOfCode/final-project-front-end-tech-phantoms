        quantity: .quantity,
        needToBuy: false

    {
        ingredient: "semolina flour",
        quantity: Math.round(1.0),
        needToBuy: false

//onClick function POSTs the ingredient .food and .quantity to json-server db


// ShoppingList page
// Fetch shopping list data from json-server and display them
// Delete shopping list item feature
//     Checkbox that will strikethrough the text, post to json-server
